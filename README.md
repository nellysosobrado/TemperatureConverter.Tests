# 🌡️ TemperatureConverter.Tests

 C# project designed for practicing **unit testing** and **basic logic implementation**. The project focuses on converting temperatures between different units and providing a textual description of temperature levels.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to practice writing and running **unit tests** using **MSTest** in C#. Each method has corresponding tests to ensure correct behavior and improve code reliability.

## Features

- Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
- Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Convert Kelvin to Celsius
- Describe temperature in words:
  - Below 10°C: "Cold"
  - 10–20°C: "Warm"
  - Above 20°C: "Hot"

## Technologies

- .NET 9 (or your installed version)
- MSTest (Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting)
